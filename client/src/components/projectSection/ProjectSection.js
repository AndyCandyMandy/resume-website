                    A collaborative research project designed with the intention to gauge, compare, and record different cursor warping mechanisms based on entirely Java and its libraries. The program is organized through a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture for organization and scalability, aiming for a low-coupling and high-cohesion framework. Using the Fittsâ€™s Index of Difficulty in conjunction with time-based trials, the program can collect and organize specific data, such as trial numbers, click errors, elapsed time, etc., to visually present in graph form.

                    A full-stack web development project built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MySQL as the database. The primary goal of this website is to enable restaurant owners to independently manage and update content, such as menu items, prices, announcements, operating hours, etc., reducing their overall reliance on developers for small but important changes to their webpage. Combines an appealing, user-friendly design with well-organized and extensible code to simplify future maintenance and updates if required by the developer.
